# Random URL
<img align="center" src="url/static/logo.png" />
Allows people to create URLs that randomly redirect to a list a websites. 

The probability of going to each site is defined in advance. 

*Example:*
```
www.google.com 25%
www.amazon.com 35%
www.microsoft.com 40%
```

Site users can change the destination / probability of going to a site after the fact by editing urls in their profile. This way if a QR code is already posted somewhere public, it can be changed easily.

## Use of Site
This project can be forked to create a custom version of this script, but it will also be available for free [here](https://random-url-generator.herokuapp.com/).
